# Experiments with webpack-dev-server

Some of my experiments with webpack-dev-server.  Trying to understand the many ways in which it can be invoked and the many ways in which it can be configured.

## Expectations

I want to end up with a setup which can:

 * Automatically check for changes in CSS, JS and HTML files
 * Make it a common gulp task that can be used across multiple projects
